## Note
This project was built as a team of 5 at the University of Bristol as a Software Engineering Project for a real client (2026). 

My contributions spanned the full stack:
- UI/UX design (wireframes, Figma designs, user flows)
- Frontend implementation
- Backend development
- Database design and Supabase API integration
- Attempted AWS deployment, which did not make it into the final release in the end, but gave me a lot of exposure to cloud infrastructure

## Project setup
- [Approach 1: Local Development](#approach-1-local-development)
- [Approach 2: Docker (recommended for quick start)](#approach-2-docker-recommended-for-quick-start)

### Approach 1: Local Development

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Flutter
- Git

#### Steps
1) **Clone repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spe-uob/2025-SecondhandMarketplace.git
# or (SSH)
git clone git@github.com:spe-uob/2025-SecondhandMarketplace.git
```

2) **Create + activate virtual environment**
- Unix (Linux/MacOS):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
- Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```
> First line creates the venv; the second line activates it (reuse for future sessions).

3) **Install backend dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```
4) **Run Flask backend**
```bash
python backend/run.py
```
5) **Install frontend dependencies**
```bash
cd application
flutter pub get
```
6) **Run Flutter frontend**
```bash
flutter run
# or specify a device:
flutter run -d [environment name - e.g: chrome]
```
*if you are having issues, find a more detailed guide to local setup [here](https://github.com/spe-uob/2025-SecondhandMarketplace/blob/task/193-improve-conciseness-of-readme/docs/project-setup/project-setup.md#local-development)*
### Approach 2: Docker (recommended for quick start)
This approach only requires Docker Desktop (or alternatives). All dependencies run inside containers.

1) **Clone repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spe-uob/2025-SecondhandMarketplace.git
# or (SSH)
git clone git@github.com:spe-uob/2025-SecondhandMarketplace.git
```
2) **Build + launch**
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
3) **Access**
- Frontend: http://localhost:8080
- Backend: http://localhost:5000

*if you are having issues, find a more detailed guide to docker setup [here](https://github.com/spe-uob/2025-SecondhandMarketplace/blob/task/193-improve-conciseness-of-readme/docs/project-setup/project-setup.md#docker)*
